**OVERVIEW**

In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### Business Understanding

**Business Perspective:**
A used car dealership wants to understand what factors drive the prices of used vehicles. Consumers typically evaluate attributes such as age, mileage, brand reputation, condition, and features when determining a car’s value.

**Data Problem Framing:**
From a data perspective, this challenge is a supervised regression task where the target variable is the car's price. Our objective is to identify the key predictors (features) that most strongly influence used car prices by building and validating a predictive model. By applying techniques like feature engineering and multiple linear regression, we aim to extract actionable insights that can help the dealership adjust its inventory and marketing strategies.

### DATA
The data used in this analysis is from Kaggle.  Uploaded in this GitHub repository is a compressed (zip) file of the CSV, this is due to Github having a restriction to upload up to 25 MB.  Full data file is 50+ MB.  Uncompress the file first before running Jupyter notebook

### CONCLUSION

**1. Focus on Well-Maintained, Lower-Mileage Vehicles**

*Why It Matters:*
Cars with fewer miles typically have fewer mechanical issues, a longer remaining lifespan, and carry a stronger sense of reliability for buyers. This often translates into a higher resale value, since customers are willing to pay extra for peace of mind.

***Action Steps:***

Inventory Selection: Seek out vehicles with verified low mileage. Checking service records and vehicle history reports helps ensure you’re getting cars that have been properly cared for.

Reconditioning Programs: Thoroughly inspect, service, and clean each car before it goes on the lot. Presenting a well-maintained, “like new” vehicle reassures customers about its quality.

Display Quality Metrics: Highlight odometer readings, maintenance logs, and any relevant service history in your online listings and showroom materials. Simple labels like “Low Mileage” can grab attention.

Customer Testimonials: If past buyers have praised the reliability of your lower-mileage vehicles, feature those reviews. Nothing beats real-life success stories to boost confidence.

**2. Highlight Certified Pre-Owned or Vehicles in Excellent Condition**

*Why It Matters:*
Cars that are certified pre-owned or labeled as “excellent” condition carry extra credibility. Buyers feel more secure knowing these vehicles have passed rigorous inspections and often come with warranties or other assurances.

***Action Steps:***

Certification Programs: Partner with recognized CPO programs or develop your own certification process. This can involve detailed inspections and minor repairs to ensure top-notch condition.

Extended Warranties: Sweeten the deal by offering extended warranties or service plans. Buyers appreciate the added safety net and are often willing to pay a bit more for it.

Clear Communication: In-store and online, use simple, eye-catching labels for certified cars. If possible, list the specific checks or criteria that make a vehicle “certified” or “excellent.”

Incentives: Provide financing perks or modest discounts on certified vehicles. This can attract cautious buyers who want reliability but also value a good deal.

**3. Use Marketing to Emphasize Age and Brand Strengths**

*Why It Matters:*
Our analysis shows that newer models and performance (like engine cylinders) matter to many shoppers. Highlighting a car’s recent model year, reputable brand, or more powerful engine can sway buyers who care about modern features and driving experience.

***Action Steps:***

Targeted Advertising: Develop campaigns that spotlight the benefits of newer models, popular brands, or better engine performance. Mention any awards or safety ratings to boost credibility.

Feature Comparison: Offer side-by-side charts—online or in-store—showing how different brands, model years, or engine specs translate into improved reliability, fuel efficiency, or overall performance.
